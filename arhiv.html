<h1>Soviet Archives Exhibit</h1>
Welcome to the Library of Congress's Soviet Archives exhibit.
<p>
<h3>How to use the exhibit</h3>

This exhibit is divided into many small displays divided on two floors.
You can visit them in any order, or follow the footsteps for a guided tour.
The guided tour will bring you back to this entrance room.
<p>
Almost every display contains images of documents from the Soviet Archives. 
These images are too small to be readable, but when you click on them, you will 
get the full size originals (each are 100-400 Kb apiece; do expect some color changes).
Hanging next to most displays is a translation on some scrolls, indicated by a
small icon: <img align=top src="gifs/translate.gif">  
<p>
It should be noted that the images often show only fragments of the document, so
don't be confused if the translation doesn't seem to match the image.<p>

<a name="tour">
You can start the guided</a> tour on either of the two floors of the exhibit hall.
<p>
The first floor, "<b>Internal Workings of the Soviet System</b>", covers
internal politics and aspects of Soviet reality that were hidden or falsified
in official propaganda.
	Follow the golden footsteps on the floor for a 
<a href="intro1.html">guided tour</a>.
<p><img src="../expo/gifs/b480.xbm">
<a name="floor1" href="intro1.html"><img src = "gifs/next.gif"></a><p>
The second floor, "<b>The Soviet Union and the United States</b>", shows
how Soviet-American relations were conducted between governments, between the
publics of the two countries, and between the Communist parties of the USSR and
the USA.
Climb the stairs to the second floor and follow the footsteps for a 
<a href="intro2.html">guided tour</a>.

<a name="floor2" href="intro2.html"><img src = "gifs/next.gif"></a>
<p>
If you prefer (or when the guide is drinking coffee) you can forget about the
guided tour and walk straight to one of the displays on the 
<a href="floor1.html">first floor</a>
or climb the stairs directly to the <a href="floor2.html">second floor</a>.
If you already know where you want to go, you can use the
<a href="overview.html">Overview of Objects and Topics</a>.<p>
<p>
